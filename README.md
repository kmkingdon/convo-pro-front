## Galvanize Web App

For this project, you will build a light application that reads and writes data, has unit tests for functions, and integrates with an API. The topic is up to you, so pick a project that speaks to your interests.

### Instructions

#### Back-end

Build an API that reads and writes data.

* You should have at least 2 collections of items. For example, if you make a school app, you should at a minimum have something like `students` and `classes`.
* You need to write some data transformation that combines the two objects. For example, combine classes and students together into one data structure.
* Your data transformations should have unit tests
* Deploy your back-end

#### Front-end

Build a client that reads and writes data from your API.

* You should have a brochure page that has information about what your app does and who it's for.
* You should have a form that writes data to your API
* You should read some data from your API that is dynamically added to the page
* Deploy your front-end
